# Release Management

This project uses [Semantic Vesioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org) with each component
tagged with a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version number upon release. The version 
numbering in SemVer is based on the following rules:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

Refer to [Semantic Vesioning](https://semver.org) guide for more details.

[Coding Guidelines](/docs/reference/development_standards#coding-guidelines)
section of the [Development Standards](/docs/reference/development_standards) 
to ensure all commits to the code repository include the required issue tracker 
numbers.
